THere is process of qr scanning

1. will check qr is valid or not
2. If it is valid, is it asssigned to some item
3. if it is not assigned to someone it will check login or signup
4. if user is logged in it will take to add items on this qr screeen comes
5. if user is not logged he will login (i not have account he will create account then will navigate to add item scrren with this qr).
6. if item is assigned to something then it will be founder , mail sent to item owner'email

so my questiion is what link should i put on qr so all this things are managed, bcz currenlty i have also scanner within app, so basically user will add item from here, and if any founder he will use the bascia phones scanner
